# Sqweebu AI Voice Assistant

Real-time voice communication with Locally hosted or Remote LLMs

Leveraging the recent advancments and general accessibility Artificial Intelligence, Sqweebu AI Voice Assistant utilizes the Vosk API for real-time speech to text transcription. Queries are sent into a locally hosted Ollama server or remote via ChatGPT API. Finally, responses are forwarded to Microsoft Azure's Speech Synthesis service.

This application has been written and designed in Rust with Tauri to ensure cross-platform optimization and compatibility.

Initially I really wanted this to be a Privacy-focused, Self-Hosted solution although until locally hosted speech synthesis becomes more relatively accessible I believe interacting with the cloud is our best option for now.
